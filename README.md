###Game backstory

Some say there are monsters underneath their beds. Mine are above and around me, predatory and persistent in the chase. My will, however, is fortified and my wheelchair is equipped with weaponry and all that I need to succeed in my personal journey over land and water and up to the mountaintop.

I, too, am persistent to wheel forward in spite of changes that shock and awe. Change, after all, is the one variable that is constant. Lifeâ€™s delight may turn topsy-turvy in one breath. I remind myself to breath so that I might ultimately reach heights hitherto unknown and find joy in the ride.
